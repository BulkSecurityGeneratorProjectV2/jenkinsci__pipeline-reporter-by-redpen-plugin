    Redpen Plugin helps in reporting the pipeline failures to Jira tickets.
    The Jenkins pipeline trigged (e.g. by a GitHub branch) when fails, the Redpen plugin will add the failure summary, attach pipeline logs as comments to the Jira ticket. Important: The GitHub branch that triggers Jenkins pipeline should have the Jira ticket number in the branch name.
